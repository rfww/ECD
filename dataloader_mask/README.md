# Something about dataset.
1. We don't use these codes to mask the controversial area in VL-CMU-CD and CDnet2014 datasets. We find that mask out 
the controversial area on CDnet dataset will lead an improvement. Because of no certainly masked label on VL-CMU-CD, we 
give up using this training policy.
